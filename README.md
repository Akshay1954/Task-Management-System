# Task-Management-System
The Task Management System is a command-line application designed to help users manage their tasks. Users can register, log in, and create tasks with statuses such as "pending", "in progress", or "completed". The application interacts with a database to store user credentials and tasks, ensuring data persistence across sessions. It focuses on backend functionality without a GUI, making use of a database for managing user data and tasks.
